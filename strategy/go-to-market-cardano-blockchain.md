# Cardano Go-To-Market Strategy

**Executive Summary**

Cardano envisions a future where it serves as the robust and scalable
foundation for a decentralized global economy. This will be achieved by
significantly enhancing L1 performance, optimizing the codebase, and expanding
the capabilities of L2 solutions. Cardano will empower developers to build
innovative and impactful applications through enhanced APIs, robust tooling,
and a focus on decentralization. The platform will unlock new possibilities for
decentralized finance and beyond through the expansion of programmable assets,
including advanced features. Cardano is committed to research, community
collaboration, and long-term sustainability, fostering a thriving ecosystem
through strategic partnerships, developer support, and community engagement.
Cardano aims to be the leading platform for real-world asset tokenization and a
premier DeFi platform for Bitcoin, leveraging its unique modular design,
scientifically-backed development, and commitment to decentralization.

Approach: Combine visionary leadership with data-driven execution. Emphasize
scientific rigor, real-world utility (Real World Assets (RWA), Bitcoin DeFi),
decentralization, and its role as a secure L1 for a thriving ecosystem.

KPIs:

* Developer Activity
* Enterprise Integration
* Network Performance
* Ecosystem Growth (including scaling solutions and partner chains)
* Societal Impact
* Governance Participation
* Decentralization Metrics (EDI)
* Scaling Solution/Partner Chain Adoption

4 Ps:

* **Product:** A scientifically developed and rigorously tested, secure and
  decentralized Layer 1 blockchain, engineered for long-term sustainability and
  scalability. Cardano empowers developers and enterprises to build a wide

  DeFi, and serves as a robust foundation for a thriving ecosystem of scaling
  solutions and partner chains.
* **Price:** Cardano aims for a competitive, predictable, and sustainable cost
  structure for all participants. The network is designed for long-term
  economic health, with a balanced approach to incentivizing participation and
  maintaining affordability. This includes optimizing transaction fees,
  providing fair compensation to stake pool operators, enabling cost-effective
  infrastructure for dApp development, and utilizing the treasury system for
  long-term financial support.
* **Place:** Cardano's focus extends beyond the blockchain space, aiming to
  provide solutions for real-world challenges. Its technology is designed to
  empower governments, businesses, and individuals globally, fostering greater
  transparency, efficiency, and collaboration. Cardano seeks to integrate into
  existing systems and processes, becoming a foundational technology for
  diverse sectors.
* **Promotion:** Communicate Cardano's value proposition through compelling
  narratives and targeted outreach that highlight its real-world
  problem-solving capabilities and its role as an enabling technology. Showcase
  impactful use cases across diverse sectors, demonstrating how Cardano
  empowers governments, businesses, and individuals to achieve greater
  transparency, efficiency, and collaboration. Drive thought leadership and
  educational initiatives that position Cardano as a key component in building
  a more inclusive and efficient world, emphasizing *how* we tell that story to
  the world.
